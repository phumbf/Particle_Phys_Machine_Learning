Some examples of machine learning projects within a particle physics context.

The first project uses a convolutional neural network to classify simulated particle tracks into
different species. 

The second project uses the XGBoost Boosted Decision Tree algorithm to separate signal from combinatorial
backgrounds in large particle physics data sets.
