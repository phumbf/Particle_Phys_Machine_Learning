Some examples of machine learning projects used within a particle physics context.

Two projects are included within the repo. The first  uses a convolutional neural network to classify simulated particle tracks into
different species. The second  uses the XGBoost Boosted Decision Tree algorithm to separate signal from backgrounds in large particle physics data sets.
